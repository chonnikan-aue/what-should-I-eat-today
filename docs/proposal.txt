- As a user, I don't know what to eat today, so I random a menu from api.

- As a user, I think maybe I don't want to eat the first random menu, so I will choose from 12 random menus (6 rounds) and the last menu will be chosen

- As a user, I want the web show me the recipe, so I can cook myself

- As a user, maybe I have category in my mind but I don't know what exactly menu, so I will make it random from category
